<h2 id="ingredients-20">Ingredients</h2>
<li>1 pie crust (pre-made or unroll the Pillsbury one)</li>
<li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
<li>1 tsp. cinnamon</li>
<li>1/2 tsp. ginger</li>
<li>1/4 tsp. cloves</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1-12oz. can pumpkin</li>
<li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
<h2 id="instructions-20">Instructions</h2>
<p>Mix sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger and cloves in small bowl. Add eggs and pumpkin. Add evaporated milk. Pour into pie shell. Bake in preheated 425 degree oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees and bake 40-50 minutes more or until knife inserted near the center comes out clean. Cool on wire rack for 2 hours. Serve immediately or refrigerate.</p>
<p>FYI: After cooking, if your pie cracks, that is a sign that it cooked to long. Hard to know. It doesn't effect the taste, just the look of it. In my oven, it is usually done in 40 minutes.</p>
