<h2 id="ingredients-18">Ingredients</h2>
<li>1 Tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>2 ¼ cups all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons sugar</li>
<li>1 cup warm water</li>
<li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
<li>10 oz. monterey jack cheese, shredded</li>

<h2 id="instructions-18">Instructions</h2>
<p>Spray 13x9 pan with cooking spray. Brush bottom and sides of the pan with the tablespoon of olive oil. In a stand mixer and dough hook (or bread machine), mix the flour, yeast and sugar. With the mixer running, slowly add the water and mix until the dough forms and no dry flour remains, about 2 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Add salt to the mixing bowl and knead dough on medium speed until the dough is smooth and clears the sides of the bowl, about 7 minutes. Transfer dough to the prepared 13x9 pan, cover with plastic wrap and allow to rest for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>After letting dough rest, press dough into the corners of the pan (oil fingers if necessary to make it easier). And let dough rest again until doubled in size, about 2 hours. <em><strong>(I put all of the dough ingredients into the bread machine on the dough cycle and then it gets all the raising done during the cycle and then I put it in the pan for the final 2 hour rising).</strong></em></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 500 degrees.</p>
<p>Sprinkle cheese over the dough evenly all the way to the sides of the pan. Spoon 3 (1 inch wide) strips of sauce over the cheese evenly down the length of the pan. Bake until the cheese is melted and starting to brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let pizza cook in the pan on a rack for 5 more minutes. Cut into squares to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Tomato Sauce</strong>: Mix 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes, 1 teaspoon dried basil or 1 Tablespoon chopped fresh basil, 1minced garlic clove, 1 teaspoon oregano, ½ teaspoon each sugar, salt, and pepper</p>
