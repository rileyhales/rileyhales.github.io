<h2 id="ingredients-22">Ingredients</h2>
<li>10-15 russet potatoes with skins on</li>
<li>1 lb. butter</li>
<li>2 cups of milk</li>
<li>1 bulb of garlic</li>
<h2 id="instructions-22">Instructions</h2>
<p>Quarter the potatoes and put in cold water with salt. Bring to a boil. While the potatoes are coming to a boil, put the butter, the whole bulb of garlic (with the top cut off) and 2 cups of milk in a pan on low heat. When the potatoes are tender, drain them and put them in a bowl to mash. Add the butter mixture slowly (so you don’t add too much and make them soupy) and mix.</p>
<p>*Brother Bloom served this with a boneless chicken breast wrapped in bacon (around the edges and held together with a toothpick) baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.</p>
