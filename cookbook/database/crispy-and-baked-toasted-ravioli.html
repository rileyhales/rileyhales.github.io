<h2 id="ingredients-24">Ingredients</h2>
<li>1 12-oz package refrigerated ravioli</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 tablespoon water</li>
<li>½ cup of Panko breadcrumbs</li>
<li>1 ½ tablespoon dried chopped onion</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon dried parsley</li>
<li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
<li>Marinara sauce or desired dipping sauce</li>
<h2 id="instructions-24">Instructions</h2>
<p>Heat oven to 400 degrees and place an oven safe wire rack on a baking sheet (I put foil under to make clean up easier). Spray rack with cooking spray.</p>
<p>In a bowl, add egg and water and whisk until thoroughly combined and mixture is light colored.</p>
<p>In a separate bowl, add breadcrumbs, onion, basil, parsley and garlic powder and whisk to combine.</p>
<p>Dip each ravioli in the bowl with egg mixture, then coat with breadcrumbs, pressing the breadcrumbs onto the ravioli to help it adhere. Place ravioli on the rack and continue until all ravioli are coated. Once all on the rack, spray ravioli with olive oil or cooking spray.</p>
<p>Bake for 15-20 minutes or until ravioli are crisp and golden brown. Remove and let ravioli cool for a minute before serving. Dip in your favorite marinara or dipping sauce.</p>
<p>*Dad ate this with Craig on a trip. It is a famous food to eat in St. Louis, where Craig is from.</p>
