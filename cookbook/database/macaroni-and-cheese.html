<h1 id="macaroni-and-cheese">Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
<h2 id="ingredients-8">Ingredients</h2>
<li>2 cups dry elbow macaroni</li>
<li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
<li>2 cups shredded monterey jack cheese</li>
<li>1 can evaporated milk</li>
<h2 id="instructions-8">Instructions</h2>
<p>Lightly spray a 2 ½ quart casserole dish. Cook macaroni in a saucepan according to directions on box. Drain and add to saucepan. Add cheeses and milk, saving ½ cup of cheese to spread on the top. Bake 20 minutes covered with foil and then remove foil and bake another 10 minutes. Let sit for a few minutes before serving.</p>
<p>*This recipe can be cut in half and also other cheeses can be used. I have used pepper jack in place of the monterey jack and it is very good. I have also added leftover crumbled bacon too.</p>
