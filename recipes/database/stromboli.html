Top with filling of your choice. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese (about 1 ½- 2 cups). Start on end and roll length-wise so it is a long log. Pinch to close the seam and make sure it is on the bottom when transferring it to the baking sheet. Top with olive oil and the rest of the italian dressing mix packet. Cut 3-5 slits to vent. Bake at 375 degrees for 20-30 minutes until the bread is cooked. Slice and serve with dipping sauce.</p>
