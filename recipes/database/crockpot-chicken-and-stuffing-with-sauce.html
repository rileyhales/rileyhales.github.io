<li>2 boxes of stove top stuffing</li>
<li>1 cup sour cream</li>
<li>1 can cream of chicken soup</li>

<h2 id="instructions-13">Instructions</h2>
<p>This recipe can easily be halved if needed. Place chicken in the bottom of the crockpot. Spread stuffing mix on top and then a mixture of sour cream and cream of chicken soup. (I like to double the sauce part to make it saucier). Top with a bag of frozen green beans. Cook on low for 4 hours.</p>
