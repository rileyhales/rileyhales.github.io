<h1 id="salmon-milano">Salmon Milano</h1>
<p>this is the salmon at Costco in the prepared food section</p>
<h2 id="ingredients-4">Ingredients</h2>
<p>6 pieces of salmon</p>
<p>Sprig of dill to add to the pan (optional)</p>
<p>Basil Pesto Butter:</p>
<p>¼ cup fresh basil leaves</p>
<p>3 cloves garlic</p>
<p>1 ½ teaspoons lemon juice</p>
<p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p>½ cup butter, softened</p>
<h2 id="instructions-4">Instructions</h2>
<p>Blend in a food processor or blender until smooth. Place one scoop of butter (about 2 tablespoons) on a piece of salmon. Bake at 400 degrees in an ungreased baking pan with a sprig of dill on the side (optional). Bake for 25-30 minutes or until 145 degrees.</p>
<p>*You can use store-bought pesto as well. Just add some (maybe 2 Tablespoons or whatever looks good) to ½ cup of softened butter.</p>
<p>*You can also cook it in the instant pot. I put a piece of foil on the rack after adding 1 cup of water to the bottom and put the fish and butter pesto on top of the foil. Steam on high pressure for 3 minutes. I can only fit 2 pieces of salmon on the foil.</p>
